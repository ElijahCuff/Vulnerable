# Vulnerable
Automatic Device Vulnerability Scanner in PHP with the ExploitDB CSV on GitHub,

## The Plan
I plan to develop this once forgotten project in my backups to create a new type of vulnerability scanner.. I see so many Fake telephone scam websites that say "You May Have A Virus" - But none that are really tackling a Web App that can scan the device, just Scammers.
    
So i made this script to do a real device scan, by taking the Browser Version and Device Version from the User Agent string provided by the browser, you can check for Known vulnerabilities on the web and Warn the user that they actually are potentially unsafe.
    
The main goal is to see a URL Shortening service emerge that automatically warns users who access links on vulnerable or dangerous devices.
 
The user could simply see a quick Notification saying, "Hey we've noticed your using an unsafe browser or device, are you sure you'd like to continue to the website with this insecure environment ?".
 

P.S - The API Keys are burners, so feel free to use them "about 10,000 searches per month i Think".
